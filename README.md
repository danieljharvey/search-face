# search-face
Fire up a browser and do a quick search from the command line, great.

### Install

Plop the `searchface` script in your path and then do something like

### Usage

`searchface "picture of an angry dog"`

or `searchface plops`

That's about it really.

### Disclaimer

It only uses Google Chrome at the moment, in the default location. Fairly easy to change it in the script if you've moved it or something though.

Firefox kind of works but sprays nonsense into the terminal window and I gave up fixing it.
